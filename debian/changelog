collectd (5.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - Fixed a segfault in the ethstat plugin; thanks to Maximilian Engelhardt

      available; thanks to Simon Richter for reporting this (Closes: #679163).
    New plugins:
    - read statistics from Aquaero 5 watercooling boards: aquaero (disabled in
      Debian because of missing dependencies)
    - CPU accounting information for Linux process groups: cgroups (disabled
      on non-Linux systems)
    - Logical Volume Manager usage: lvm (disabled on non-Linux systems)

  * debian/control, debian/rules:
    - Depend on libmnl-dev and enable the netlink plugin on all architectures

      available as a static non-PIC library on Debian) (Closes: #531352).
    - Depend on liblvm2-dev and enable the LVM plugin on Linux.
  * debian/rules:

      (Closes: #615203)
    - Build-conflict with libhal-dev to ensure consistent builds (cf. #615203).
    - Let libcollectdclient-dev replace/break collectd-dev (<< 5.2.0-1)
      because it ships files previously shipped by that package; thanks to
      Andreas Beckmann for reporting this (Closes: #717973).
    - Let collectd-core / collectd suggest / recommend default-jre-headless
      (cf. #683525).
  * debian/collectd-core.collectd.init.d:
    - Do not use different PID files for collectd and collectdmon. Else, a

collectd (5.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - ping plugin: Don't abort if ping_send fails but report an error only;
      thanks to Bernd Zeimetz for reporting this (Closes: #630683).
    - df plugin: Ignore "rootfs" file-system type to make sure that root
      file-system statistics are only collected once; thanks to Florian La
      Roche for reporting this (Closes: #657122).
    - Fixed parse errors when using (including) empty config files; thanks to
      Reinhard Tartler for reporting this (Closes: #592881).
    New plugins:
    - Aggregate multiple values lists into one: aggregation
    - Query statistics from BSD's packet filter: pf (FreeBSD only)
  * Uploading to experimental because of the Wheezy freeze.
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
    - Build-depend on kfreebsd-kernel-headers (kfreebsd-any only) and disable
      the 'pf' plugin on non-kfreebsd systems.
  * debian/patches:
    - Removed migrate-4-5-df.dpatch; merged upstream.
    - Removed rtnl_dump_filter.dpatch; merged upstream.
    - Added myplugin_includes.dpatch -- change the example plugin include path
      to /usr/include/collectd/core/ (see below).
    - rrd_filter_path.dpatch: Also patch the migrate-4-5 script; while this is
      not required for the (optional) auto-migration when updating the package
      (the full path is passed as an argument) it helps the user to just use
      the script without the need to add further arguments; thanks to Joey
      Hess for reporting this (Closes: #689001).
  * debian/rules:
    - Fix installation paths used for Perl bindings. Upstream now passes
      INSTALL_BASE rather than PREFIX to Makefile.PL which resulted in the
      bindings being installed to different locations than before.
  * debian/collectd-utils.install:
    - Install collectd-tg(1).
  * debian/libcollectdclient-dev.install:
    - Install the libcollectdclient network*.h header files.
  * Renamed libcollectclient0 to libcollectdclient1 due to the SONAME version
    bump.
  * debian/libcollectdclient1.symbols:
    - Updated for 5.2.
  * debian/collectd-dev.install:
    - Install the collectd (daemon) headers to /usr/include/collectd/core/
      rather than /usr/include/collectd/. The latter is used by
      libcollectdclient which causes file conflicts.
  * debian/collectd.conf:
    - Let the 'df' plugin ignore 'rootfs' (else, the root file-system would
      appear twice, causing one of the updates to fail and spam the log) and
      the usual virtual / temporary file-systems (cf. #657122).
  * debian/collectd-core.postrm:
    - Source the debconf confmodule to make the db_* functions available;
      thanks to Joey Hess and YunQiang Su for reporting this
      (Closes: #680172, #688285).
  * debian/po:
    - Updated Brazilian Portuguese debconf templates; thanks to Adriano Rafael
      Gomes (Closes: #685760).

    - Catch disabled state in start and restart and don't exit with an error

      Evgeni Golov for providing (an early) patch (Closes: #681216).
    - Don't use 'set -e' and 'exit 0' (at the end) in order to let return

    - Explicitly build-depend on libkvm-dev on kfreebsd; this is required by
      the processes, swap and tcpconns plugins.
  * debian/collectd-core.postrm, debian/collectd-core.templates:
    - Prompt the user (debconf priority high) when purging the collected data
      providing an option to opt out. The question defaults to remove the
      data; thanks to Trent W. Buck for reporting and discussing this
      (Closes: #631167).
  * debian/collectd-core.collectd.init.d:
    - Added cpufrequtils to should-start, else collectd does not reliably
      detect all CPUs; thanks to Mathias Bauer for reporting and debugging

collectd (4.10.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Added support for Yajl version 2; thanks to John Stamp for reporting
      this (Closes: #653879).
    - collectd.conf(5) now documents the "Globals" config option and that this
      is required for the "perl" and "python" plugins; thanks to Jeff Green
      for reporting this (Closes: #612784).
    - Be more verbose about why loading a plugin fails; thanks to Martin
      Steigerwald for reporting this (Closes: #585975).
    - Don't abort if including a config file fails; thanks to Reinhard Tartler
      for reporting this (Closes: #592880).
    - Fixed FTBFS with GCC 4.6; thanks to Matthias Klose for reporting this
      and Peter Green and Colin Watson for providing patches

      by policy.
  * debian/patches/ipvs_h_include, debian/rules:

      make sure to look for the header in /usr/include rather than the kernel
      directory (which has been deprecated).
    - Force building of the ipvs plugin since configure is not currently able
      to correctly check for ip_vs.h.

      to compare DEB_BUILD_ARCH with kfreebsd-{amd64,i386}; thanks to ilia
      kudirov for reporting this (Closes: #567259).
    - Replaced all occurrences of 'findstring' with appropriate 'filter'
      statements to make sure to match words rather than substrings.

 -- Sebastian Harl <tokkee@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jan 2010 22:09:16 +0100

collectd (4.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    New plugins:
    - Number of context switches done by the OS: contextswitch
    - Query statistics from mon.itor.us: Monitorus (Perl based plugin)
    - Collect statistics from NetApp filers: netapp (disabled in Debian;
      libnetapp is not available)
    - OpenVZ statistics: OpenVZ (Perl based plugin)
    - Embedding a Python interpreter: python
    - Query statistics from RouterOS: routeros (disabled in Debian;
      librouteros is not available)
    New matches:
    - Match values using a hash function of the hostname: hashed
    New targets:
    - Scale (multiply) values: scale
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on "python-dev", required to build the "python" plugin.
  * debian/collectd-core.install:
    - Install all collectd-*.5 manpages (in particular, this includes the
      newly added collectd-python.5).
  * Added support for kfreebsd-{i386,amd64}; see below for details
    (Closes: #566521).
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
    - Disabled the following Linux-specific plugins / removed the following
      build-deps on kfreebsd-{i386,amd64}:
      + "iptables" plugin / iptables-dev
      + "ipvs" plugin / linux-libc-dev
      + "madwifi" plugin
      + "netlink" plugin / iproute-dev
      + "sensors" plugin / libsensors4-dev
      + "vserver" plugin
    - Disabled the following plugins / removed the following build-deps on
      kfreebsd-{i386,amd64} -- the build-deps are (not yet) available on
      kfreebsd:
      + "gmond" plugin / libganglia1-dev
      + "libvirt" plugin / libvirt-dev
      + "java" plugin / openjdk6-jdk
    - Enabled the "rrdcached" plugin and build-depend on librrd-dev (>= 1.4~)
      (and removed the optional build-dep on librrd2-dev).
    - Enabled the "tokyotyrant" plugin (except on kfreebsd-{i386,amd64}) and
      build-depend on libtokyotyrant-dev (which is not available on kfreebsd).
      Also, build-depend on libtokyocabinet-dev to work around a missing
      dependency in libtokyotyrant-dev (see #566584).
  * debian/rules:
    - Disabled the following plugins on kfreebsd-{i386,amd64} which have not
      yet been ported to FreeBSD: battery, conntrack, contextswitch, cpufreq,
      disk, entropy, fscache, irq, nfs, protocols, serial, thermal, vmem,
      wireless.
    - Simplified Java archdir mapping: removed entries "pointing" to
      themselves and let those default to DEB_BUILD_ARCH.
    - Check whether all patches have been enabled; fail, if not.
  * debian/patches:
    - Added bts566199_collection_hide_types.dpatch -- added ability to hide
      specified types in collection.cgi; thanks to Pavel Piatruk for the patch

collectd (4.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Now using libtool 2.
  * Set urgency to medium because of the fix for #559801.
  * Split the "collectd" binary package into "collectd-core" and "collectd".
    The former provides the main program file and the plugins while the latter
    provides the configuration. This allows for much more flexible setups
    (e.g. providing customizations on top of "collectd-core" without modifying
    the "collectd" package) and, amongst others, removes the hard dependency
    on librrd (Closes: #495936, #544311).
  * debian/collectd-core.collectd.init.d:
    - Do not (try to) start collectd if the config file does not exist. Else,
      installation of "collectd-core" (which does not provide configuration)
      would fail.
  * debian/collectd.postinst:
    - Let the "collectd" package restart the daemon, since it provides the
      config file.
  * debian/collectd.links:
    - Symlink /u/s/d/collectd/examples to /u/s/d/collectd-core/examples.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on the right combination of libsnmp-dev and perl. Perl's
      CFLAGS (included in net-snmp's CFLAGS) introduced '-fstack-protector' in
      version 5.10.1 on some architectures (those supporting that features).
      net-snmp has been fixed to handle that correctly in 5.4.2.1~dfsg-4;
      thanks to Lamont Jones and Dann Frazier for reporting this
      (Closes: #559087).
    - Build-depend on libsensors4-dev rather than libsensors-dev. libsnmp-dev,
      starting with version 5.4.2.1~dfsg-5, supports libsensors4, thus making
      that possible. This restores the full functionality of the "sensors"
      plugin, which does not work well with libsensors3 and lm-sensors-3;
      thanks to Anssi Kolehmainen for reporting this (Closes: #538795).
    - Build-depend on libltdl-dev to make it possible to use the system-wide
      libltdl.
    - No longer conflict/provide/replace the pre-Lenny "collectd-$plugin"
      packages.
    - Update the list of collectd-core's suggestions: added various services
      providing data that may be collected by collectd. Downgraded lm-sensors
      from a recommendation to a suggestion.
  * debian/patches:
    - Removed gmond-fix-compile-error.dpatch -- included upstream.
    - Added bts561577_collectd2html_recursive_fix.dpatch -- fixed
      collectd2html.pl's recursive mode and improved some defaults; thanks to
      Yuri D'Elia for reporting this and providing a patch (Closes: #561577).
    - Added bts557599_powerdns_fix.dpatch -- fixed communication to pdns
      versions 2.9.22 and above; thanks to <tm@iprog.com> for reporting this
      and Luke Heberling for providing the patch (Closes: #557599).
    - Added bts559801_plugin_find_fix.dpatch -- make collectd resistant
      against copies of libltdl affected by CVE-2009-3736. This fixes a
      potential but very unlikely security issue, e.g. found in the embedded
      copy. For details about how collectd might be affected, see
      <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=559801#15>; thanks to
      Michael Gilbert for reporting this (Closes: #559801).
  * debian/rules:
    - Pass --without-included-ltdl to configure to tell libtool 2 to not use
      the shipped libltdl but rather the one available in the system. Thus,
      in the future, libltdl related issues do no longer require updated
      collectd packages.
    - Pass --disable-static to configure to tell libtool 2 to not build any
      static libraries.
    - Install debian/collectd.conf as an example into "collectd-core".
    - Output the content of config.log if configure fails -- this might help
      debugging.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Added a short explanation of the package split.

    - Updated the powerdns plugin to support pdns 2.9.22 (and above) as well;
      thanks to Thomas Morgan for reporting this and Luke Heberling for
      providing a patch (Closes: #535787).
    New plugins:
    - Parse JSON files: curl_json
    - Query data from Java processes using JMX: GenericJMX (Java based plugin)
    - Atheros wireless LAN chipset statistics: madwifi
    - Optimized Link State Routing daemon statistics: olsrd
    - Tokyo Tyrant server statistics: tokyotyrant (disabled in Debian,
      libtokyotyrant is not available)
    - Send collected values to a web-server: write_http
    - ZFS Adaptive Replacement Cache statistics: zfs_arc (disabled in Debian,
      libkstat is not available)
    New matches:
    - Match zero COUNTER values: empty_counter
  * Set urgency to medium because of the fix for #535786.
  * debian/rules:
    - Install contrib/GenericJMX.conf to /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/.
    - Disabled the tokyotyrant and zfs_arc plugins - their dependencies are
      not available.
  * debian/patches:
    - Removed bts535787-powerdns-fix-localsocket.dpatch - included upstream.
    - Removed bts541953-curl-followlocation.dpatch - included upstream.

  * debian/control:
    - Build depend on libyajl-dev, which is required by the curl_json plugin.
  * Added debian/README.source:
    - The file includes a pointer to /usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source.gz.
  * New debconf template translations:
    - ja.po, thanks to Hideki Yamane (Closes: #550968).

collectd (4.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #541887).
    - collectd2html.pl now supports the creation of SVG images; thanks to Ivan
      Shmakov for providing a patch (Closes: #482185).
    New plugins:
    - Connection tracking table size: conntrack
    - Linux file-system based caching framework statistics: fscache
    - Receive and interpret Ganglia multicast traffic: gmond
    - Embedded Java Virtual Machine: java
    - Query and parse data from a memcache daemon: memcachec
    - Information about network protocols: protocols
    - Parse table-like structured files: table
    - Power consumption measurements from "The Energy Detective" (TED): ted
    - System uptime: uptime
  * debian/rules:
    - Install collectd-unixsock.py to /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/.
    - Pass CPPFLAGS and CFLAGS as arguments to configure instead of setting
      them in the environment - this is the recommended way.
    - Pass appropriate JAVAC, JAVA_CPPFLAGS and JAVA_LDFLAGS variables to
      configure, using OpenJDK found in /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk. The
      archdir mapping used by the openjdk-6 Debian package is used to find
      libjvm.so in JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ARCHDIR/server.
    - Use -rpath to tell the "java" plugin where to find libjvm.so.
    - Pass --enable-all-plugins to configure to make sure that the build fails
      if any prerequisites are missing.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on openjdk-6-jdk.
    - Build-depend on libganglia1-dev (>= 3), required by the gmond plugin.
    - Build-depend on libgcrypt11-dev, used by the network plugin.
    - Updated Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes).
    - Changed build-dependency libmysqlclient15-dev to libmysqlclient-dev -
      this allows transitions to be handled thru binNMUs if possible.
  * debian/collectd.install:
    - Install collectd-java.5.
  * debian/patches:
    - Removed libcollectdclient_static_sstrerror.dpatch - included upstream.
    - Added network-fix-cacheflush.dpatch - upstream patch to fix the handling
      of the 'CacheFlush' config option of the "network" plugin.
    - Added libvirt-reconnect.dpatch - upstream patch to let the "libvirt"
      plugin re-connect to libvirtd if connecting fails.
    - Added plugin-fix-unregister.dpatch - upstream patch to make
      'plugin_unregister_read()' functional again, thus fixing a failed
      assertion in some cases.
    - Added java-fix-jvm-start.dpatch - upstream patch to fix the JVM startup.
    - Added bts541953-curl-followlocation.dpatch - upstream patch to let
      plugins using libcurl follow HTTP redirects; thanks to Joey Hess for
      reporting this (Closes: #541953).
    - Added bts535787-powerdns-fix-localsocket.dpatch - upstream patch fixing
      the handling of the 'LocalSocket' config option of the "powerdns"
      plugin; thanks to Thomas Morgan for reporting this and Luke Heberling
      for providing a patch (references: #535787).
    - Added bts542859-df-fix-ignorelist.dpatch - upstream patch to fix the
      handling of the ignorelist in the "df" plugin; thanks to Joey Hess for
      reporting this (Closes: #542859).
  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Removed the note about how to get collectd2html.pl working with
      version 4 of collectd - the script now supports the --recursive option
      which takes care of that.
  * debian/collectd.overrides:
    - Documented the 'binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath' warning - the rpath is
      required by the "java" plugin.
  * New debconf template translations:
    - cs.po, thanks to Martin Sin (Closes: #534206).
    - ru.po, thanks to Yuri Kozlov (Closes: #539467).
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
    - No not limit the "libvirt" plugin to amd64, i386, powerpc - libvirt-dev
      seems to be available on all architectures now.
    - Reintroduced a work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) by
      providing a fixed version of OpenIPMIpthread.pc in debian/pkgconfig and
      adding that path to PKG_CONFIG_PATH. Removed the version from the
      libopenipmi-dev build dependency for now.
  * debian/collectd.conf:
    - Set the "apache" plugin's URL according to the default used by Debian's
      Apache; thanks to Joey Hess for reporting this (Closes: #541888).
  * debian/libcollectdclient-dev.install, debian/rules:
    - Do not install libcollectdclient's .la file in favor of the Squeeze
      release goal to remove those files (for details see
      <http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/08/msg00783.html>).

collectd (4.4.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) introduced
    in 4.4.1-1 and instead build depend on libopenipmi-dev (>= 2.0.14-1~)
    which includes fixed .pc files. This fixes an undefined symbol error when
    loading the ipmi plugin caused by that work around (Closes: #494665).
  * debian/collectd.init.d:
    - The "status" command now exits with 1 if collectd is not running.
    - Do not suppress output when checking the configuration with the -t
      command line option. This will also show errors that don't cause
      collectd to abort, e.g. failure to load plugins (Closes: #499232).
  * debian/control:
    - Added librrd-dev as the preferred option to the librrd2-dev build
      dependency - the latter one is a virtual package since rrdtool 1.3.

    fix a possible file descriptor leak in the memcached plugin.
  * Added debian/patches/memcached_timeout.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix the timeout passed to poll(2).

collectd (4.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed librrd0-dev and libmysqlclient14-dev from the build-dependencies -
    those package are no longer available since Etch.
  * Removed byacc from the build-dependencies - collectd now requires bison.
  * Removed libupsclient-config.sh - upstream now supports pkg-config for
    libupsclient.
  * Include collection3 in /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/:
    - Updated README.Debian to point the collection3's README.
    - Added libconfig-general-perl to the suggested packages.
  * README.Debian: Added a note about how to get collectd2html.pl working with
    version 4 of collectd.
  * Added debian/patches/myplugin_strcpy.dpatch - use sstrncpy() instead of
    strcpy() which is poisoned in collectd.h.
  * collectd.overrides: Removed shlib-with-non-pic-code for nut.so - the
    plugin now links against the shared libupsclient.
  * Do not compress any example files, so they may be used directly.

collectd (4.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restrict libcurl4-gnutls-dev build dependency to versions which are not
    affected by #488701 (Closes: #489091).
  * Added linux-libc-dev (<< 2.6.25-1) as an option to the linux-libc-dev
    (>= 2.6.25-4) build dependency - those versions are not affected by
    #479899.
  * Added build dependency on pkg-config - this is used by collectd's
    configure script to check for a couple of libraries.
  * Added libupsclient-config.sh to imitate libupsclient-config which is no
    longer available. libupsclient-config.sh is a simple wrapper around
    pkg-config. This is a workaround until upstream supports pkg-config for
    libupsclient.
  * Replaced nut-dev build dependency with libupsclient1-dev:
    Reenabled the "nut" plugin on all architectures.

      required because of #479899.
  * New debconf template translations:
    - gl.po, thanks to Jacobo Tarrio (Closes: #482667).
  * Added a work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) by forcing the
    inclusion of the ipmi plugin and manually specifying the dependencies.

    - Removed the plugin from collectd.conf.
    - Removed /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/iptables/.

    limit will be set to unlimited - disabled by default.
  * Compile collectd with -DLT_LAZY_OR_NOW='RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL' to force

    New plugins:
    - APC UPS's charge, load, input/output/battery voltage, etc.: apcups
    - NTP daemon's local clock drift, offset to peers, etc.: ntpd
  * Upstream no longer provides a debian/ directory. Thus no repackaging is
    required any longer.
  * Not using getifaddrs() is now the default in upstream. getifaddrs.dpatch
    no longer needed.
  * Added collectd-hddtemp as a suggestion to the collectd package.

collectd (3.9.4+debian-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #373008).
  * Removed upstream's debian/ directory from .orig.tar.gz.
  * getifaddrs.dpatch: Patching src/traffic.c to read data from /proc instead
    of using getifaddrs(). getifaddrs() does not seem to work correctly on 
    AMD64.
